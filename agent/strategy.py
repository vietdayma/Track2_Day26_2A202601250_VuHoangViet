"""agent/strategy.py — discovery, delegation, caching, replica, and budget
POLICY. Where `agent/gateway.py` is the control plane (route / admit /
authorize / budget — the four JOBS a decision must do), this file is the
building blocks a real answer to those jobs is made of. Nothing here is
wired into `Gateway.decide` by default — see agent/gateway.py's own module
docstring and agent/README.md's table for where each piece is meant to
plug in. That wiring is the assignment, not a step you're missing.

THE ARITHMETIC THAT MAKES THIS FILE'S EXISTENCE THE LESSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A duel gives EACH SIDE 100 credits, ONCE, for all 10 rounds combined
(CONTRACTS.md 4.2's `GatewayContext.credits`; FINAL-PLAN.md section 4). Two
ways to spend a single round, both real, both computed against
`kit.mcp.specs.TOOL_SPECS` (this file's `__main__` demo below recomputes
them live rather than just asserting the numbers, so they can never
silently drift from the real cost table):

    DISCIPLINED  slides.query(fields=[title,body])   base1 + (body3+title1) + 1row*1  =  6
                 slides.get_frame(default fields)     base2 + (body2+title0)          =  4
                 registry.provenance(default fields)  base1 + (etag0)                 =  1
                 -------------------------------------------------------
                 = 11 credits this round — the CEILING of FINAL-PLAN.md 4.3's
                   "8-11" (a round that skips the provenance re-read, or
                   reuses a cached body via `ResultCache` below, lands
                   nearer the floor of that range instead).

    CARELESS     registry.list_servers(fields=[*])    ->            12
                 glossary.list_terms()  (default==full "punishment
                                          button", not a narrow mask) -> 10
                 slides.get_frame(fields=[*]) x3       ->  9 x 3   = 27
                 -------------------------------------------------------
                 = 49 credits — MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE WHOLE DUEL'S
                   BUDGET, spent in a single round.

Play at the DISCIPLINED CEILING (11 cr) every single round and 10 rounds
costs 110 — a hair OVER the 100-credit pool: this file's own `__main__`
demo shows that combination surviving nine full rounds and only running dry
paying for the tenth. That is not a bug in the arithmetic; it is the honest
point — "disciplined" is not a magic number, it is not re-paying for the
same provenance read or the same frame body every round when you already
have it (`ResultCache` below, and `BudgetPacer.is_affordable`'s reserve
floor). Play CARELESS even once and you are mathematically bankrupt by
round 3 (100 − 49 − 49 < 0) — not because the game is rigged against you,
but because `registry.list_servers` and `glossary.list_terms` were
deliberately built so their DEFAULT field mask is their full, expensive
dump (FINAL-PLAN.md section 4.1: "an audit showed `list_servers` and
`list_terms` each exceeded a whole round's sustainable allowance —
punishment buttons, not decisions"). Naming exactly the fields you plan to
actually CITE, every time, is not a minor optimisation here; it is the
difference between finishing the duel and not.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads.
