"""eval/prosecute.py — Task 2: the prosecutor (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1).

    def prosecute(trace: list[dict], answer: dict, card: dict) -> dict:
        '''Return {"v": 1, "claims": [...]}. SYNCHRONOUS, no I/O, no network,
        5 s deadline. `trace` is the opponent's L1 events only (CONTRACTS.md
        section 5.4).'''

Your gateway (`agent/gateway.py`) is what your infrastructure ENFORCES. This file is
what you can PROVE about somebody else's. CONTRACTS.md section 6.1's rule that
matters most: **no claim, no damage** — an attack that lands but you cannot cite
evidence for earns nothing, and a claim that misreads its own evidence costs YOU.

WHAT THIS STARTER GIVES YOU
-----------------------------
One competently-implemented detector — `detect_enforcement_failure` — because
`enforcement_failure` (weight 10) is both the heaviest class and the most
mechanical: CONTRACTS.md section 6.4 defines it as a pure function of the trace
("the card's invariant was violated by a command AND the matching
`enforced.verdict_applied != 'deny'`"), with no text to read and no judgement call.
Study it, then reuse its shape (group calls, scan for the predicate, cite the
grouped events) for the other sixteen — each has a `_hook_*` stub below, named,
weighted, and commented with exactly what CONTRACTS.md section 6.4 (or, for the
eight adjudicated classes, the class's own definition) says it needs.

Also provided so you spend your time on DETECTION, not on JSON shape:

  * `evt_ref` / `span_ref` / `anchor_ref` — the three evidence-ref grammars
    (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1: `"evt:NNNN"` | `"answer.span:N"` | `"anchor:<A>"`).
  * `group_calls(trace)` — buckets L1 events into per-`command` groups
    (`command`/`decision`/`enforced`/`tool_call`/`tool_result`/`mutations`), the
    correlation `detect_enforcement_failure` (and most other detectors) need.
  * `split_sentences(text)` — the exact `answer.span:N` sentence split.
  * `ProsecutionBudget` — a claim accumulator that enforces "at most 4 claims, at
    most 1 per family" BY CONSTRUCTION, so a detector that fires five times cannot
    accidentally over-file; it silently keeps the first per family and reports what
    it dropped via `.dropped`.
  * `score_prosecutor(fn, fixtures)` — measures ANY `prosecute`-shaped callable
    against `fixtures/prosecution/labelled/`, so you find out where your detector
    is wrong before an opponent's trace costs you a duel.

THE ECONOMICS — READ THIS BEFORE YOU WRITE A DETECTOR
---------------------------------------------------------
CONTRACTS.md section 6.2's outcome table: a `verified` claim earns `+weight`; a
`false` claim costs `-0.8 * weight` (both `* round_scale`, applied once at fold
time — not this module's concern). Filing blind is +EV exactly when

    p(verified) * weight  >  (1 - p(verified)) * 0.8 * weight

which rearranges to `p > 0.8 / 1.8 = 4/9 = 0.4444...` — and because BOTH sides of
that inequality carry a factor of `weight`, IT CANCELS. The break-even is
**44.4% for every one of the 17 classes, weight-10 `enforcement_failure` and
weight-3 `wasteful` alike.** There is no weight to shop for.

Contrast the flat penalty an earlier draft of this game used, and never shipped —
`break_even_probability(cls, scheme="flat")` below computes it purely so this
arithmetic is demonstrable, not asserted; nothing in this module ever scores a
claim under it. A flat `-4` makes blind filing +EV whenever `p > 4 / (weight + 4)`.
For `enforcement_failure` (weight 10)
that is `4/14 = 28.6%` — visibly easier to clear than for `wasteful` (weight 3,
`4/7 = 57.1%`), so a prosecutor optimizing under a flat penalty would rationally
shotgun the heavy classes and go quiet on the light ones. **Under the scheme this
lab actually uses, that strategy is not rational: every class costs the same
44.4% conviction rate to be worth filing at all.** File what you can prove, not
what pays the most if you happen to be right.

Stdlib only. No network, no unseeded randomness, no wall-clock inside `prosecute`
itself (the 5 s deadline is measured by the CALLER — `score_prosecutor` here, and
the real referee in the arena — never baked into the claims themselves).
